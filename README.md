# Ecommerce Trends in the United States
Team Members: Jeremy Najera & Maria Quinton

Project Description/Outline:

    Our project is to uncover trends in ecommerce business across the United States, specifically by state. We will examine relationships between ecommerce trends and state; ecommerce products and ecommerce trends; along with number of ecommerce establishments and state.

Project Writeup:

    1. Do certain states in the U.S. use ecommerce more than in-person shopping?
    Our research found us to reject the alt hypothesis and accept the null to be true. We found location in the United States does not relate to ecommerce and in-person trends therefore they are no affected. Keeping in mind we only analyzed a sample of the U.S., but of the five states examined percentages of ecommerce and in-person shopping were very similar, with small variations. Overall, in-person shopping accounted for the majority of dollars spent per state. In each state over 80% of retail spending was spent in-person at brick and mortar establisments.

    2. What are the top five product/product categories for ecommerce in the U.S.?
    After examining the retail data history from 2018-1998 we found the top five product categories to be:
    1. Nonstore retailers
    2. Electronic Shopping & Mail order houses
    3. Motor Vehicle
    4. Clothing & Accessories
    5. Misc. Stores
    - Relevent plots: Bar charts with product categories
    3. Does ecommerce business increase based on location?
    By comparing number of establishments for ecommerce across five states, we found that ecommerce business does seem to increase state by state, but not without more data on other factors we cannot say there is a causation of why.

Research Questions to Answer:

1. Do certain states in the U.S. use ecommerce more than in-person shopping?
    * Alt:
        * If location relates to ecommerce and in-person shopping trends, then eccomerce trends will be affected.
    * Null:
        * If location does not relates to ecommerce and in-person shopping trends, then eccomerce trends will not be affected.

2. What are the top five products/product categories for ecommerce in the U.S.?
    * Alt: 
        * If ecommerce business relates to product type, then certain products are more likely to be purchased online.
    * Null: 
        * If ecommerce business does not relate to product type, then certain products are not more likely to be purchased online.
3. Does ecommerce business increase based on location?
    * Alt:
        * If location affects ecommerce business, then certain states will have more ecommerce businesses than others.
    * Null:
        * If location does not affect ecommerce business, then certain states will not have more ecommerce businesses than others.
